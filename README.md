# gatsby-source-api-test
Gatsby site with a local plugin so I can get better at pulling in data from a 3rd party API at build time.

For the data source I'm using the [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/).

Running this site is just like any other Gatsby site:
```
yarn develop
```

Code taken from [gatsby-source-medium](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-medium) and
some implmentation based on that from
[the Gatsby "using Contentful" example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-contentful).
